# WearTube

A clean, fast YouTube browsing experience tailored for Wear OS watches. Built with Jetpack Compose for Wear OS, optimized for small, round screens, and designed for quick, glanceable interactions.

---

## Highlights

- üéûÔ∏è Trending & search-first UX with watch-friendly controls
- üß≠ Swipe-to-dismiss navigation and on-wrist ergonomics
- ‚ö° Compose performance patterns for wearable form factors
- üß© Reusable UI building blocks (cards, lists, error/loading states)
- üé¨ Shorts-style two-column layout for quick discovery

---

## Screens & Components

- HomeScreen
  - Trending feed by default
  - Real-time search (titles, channels, descriptions)
  - Clear loading and error states
- VideoPlayerScreen
  - Play/Pause mock playback (demo mode)
  - Progress indicator, metadata, and compact controls
- Reusable components
  - VideoItem: thumbnail + title + channel
  - SearchBar: compact, thumb-friendly input
  - LoadingIndicator & ErrorMessage
  - ShortItem & ShortsGrid: 2-column, vertically scrolling layout

> Shorts layout is available via `ShortsGrid(videos, onClick)` from `presentation/components/VideoComponents.kt`.

## Tech Stack

- Jetpack Compose for Wear OS (Material components, ScalingLazyColumn)
- ViewModel + StateFlow for state management
- Coil for image loading
- Navigation for Compose
- Retrofit (ready for API integration)

## Quickstart

Prereqs
- Android Studio Electric Eel (or newer)
- JDK 17 (Android Studio bundled JDK is fine)
- Wear OS Emulator or a physical Wear OS watch

Build & Run
1. Open this project in Android Studio
2. Let Gradle sync dependencies
3. Launch a Wear OS emulator (or connect a device)
4. Run the `app` configuration

CLI build
```
./gradlew :app:assembleDebug
```

---

## YouTube API (optional, production)

Out of the box the app uses a mock repository for a smooth demo experience. To use the real YouTube Data API v3:

1) Create an API key
- Open Google Cloud Console
- Enable ‚ÄúYouTube Data API v3‚Äù
- Create an API key

2) Wire the repository
- Replace `MockYouTubeRepository` with `YouTubeRepository` in your ViewModels

```kotlin
// HomeViewModel.kt, VideoPlayerViewModel.kt
private val repository = YouTubeRepository()
```

3) Provide the API key
```kotlin
// YouTubeRepository.kt
private val apiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY"
```

Notes
- Consider quota, caching, pagination, and errors for production
- Some features may require OAuth 2.0 (user context)

---

## Shorts Layout

Use the 2-column Shorts grid wherever you need quick discovery:

```kotlin
ShortsGrid(
  videos = videos,
  onClick = { video -> /* open details */ }
)
```

Under the hood:
- `ShortItem`: 16:9 thumbnail + title + lightweight view line
- `ShortsGrid`: vertical scroll, chunked into rows of two

---

## Cleanup & Housekeeping

Transient build artifacts and IDE caches can balloon quickly. This repo includes a small utility to prune them safely.

Clean the project (repo only)
```
bash scripts/clean.sh --yes
```

Clean + purge local Gradle cache (heavy)
```
bash scripts/clean.sh --yes --all
```

What it removes
- Module and root build dirs (`**/build/`, `/build/`)
- `.gradle/`, `.kotlin/`
- Common Android Studio caches in `.idea/`
- Native build folders (`.externalNativeBuild/`, `.cxx/`)
- Captures, `.DS_Store`

> `.gitignore` is hardened to keep these artifacts out of version control.

---

## Development Tips

- Keep composables preview-friendly: provide safe default parameters in previews
- Watch form factor: prefer short text, large tap targets, and vertical layouts
- Use `ScalingLazyColumn` for watch-optimized scrolling
- Avoid heavy recomposition in list items (remember state, key items)

---

## Roadmap

- ExoPlayer-based playback on-device
- Voice Search
- Tiles & Complications for quick access
- Subscriptions and authenticated feeds
- Offline caching and paging

---

## Troubleshooting

- Gradle sync issues
  - File > Invalidate Caches / Restart
  - Run the cleanup script, then re-sync
- Image loading
  - Verify network and URLs; Coil logs in Logcat can help
- Emulator performance
  - Cold boot, disable animations, increase RAM if needed

---

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch
3. Make focused commits with clear messages
4. Test on a Wear OS emulator/device
5. Open a PR (screenshots welcome!)
